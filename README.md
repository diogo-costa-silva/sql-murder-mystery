This repository contains my solution to SQL Murder Mystery, an interactive programming challenge developed by Knight Lab. The objective of the game is to solve a murder mystery using SQL skills to interrogate a database and discover the culprit.

#### Original Statement

There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime.

The original statement is as follows: A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a **murder** that occurred sometime on **Jan.15, 2018** and that it took place in **SQL City**.
