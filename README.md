# SQL Murder Mystery

This repository contains my solution to SQL Murder Mystery, an interactive programming challenge developed by Knight Lab. The objective of the game is to solve a murder mystery using SQL skills to interrogate a database and discover the culprit.

You can solve the mystery on their website (http://mystery.knightlab.com/) itself or download it from the github repository (https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries) and solve it in your preferred method.

I have uploaded the database file in this very repository.

**Below is the schema of the database:**
